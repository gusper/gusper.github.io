### Web
Only one still up is [GuitarTube.org](https://guitartube.org). Some others that are no longer around are Roomdash ([GitHub repo](https://github.com/gusper/Roomdash)) and Countdowns.me.

### Extensions
Only two I'm still maintaining are [SearchSwap](searchswap) (Edge/Chrome) and [SongTxt](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gusper.songtxt) ([GitHub repo](https://github.com/gusper/SongTxt-vscode)) (Visual Studio Code). You can still get [LinkSmith](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/linksmith/ceogkejjjehhiacafhoplekoldlcfbhp) (Chrome/Edge) but it's no longer as useful. Way back, I also built Snippy (Visual Studio) but no chance that's useful nowadays unless you're still using VS 2003/2005. If you are, please upgrade! ðŸ˜Š

### Windows
Lots of stuff over the years, much of which isn't all that useful nowadays. Here's a quick list of app names and I've provided links to GitHub repos for any that I shared there: [SnipJoin](https://github.com/gusper/SnipJoin), [Wordy](https://github.com/gusper/Wordy), [Peekify](https://github.com/gusper/Peekify), TickTalker, DeskTips, Clipboard Snagger, [ezClip](https://github.com/gusper/ezClip), RightSideUp, Hovervue, NameTag, NameTray, Uptime 2000, and a quick version of [Space Invaders](https://github.com/gusper/SpaceInvaders).

### Cross-platform 
A Python script I used to automatically rename photo/video files we've taken with our phones over the years called [PhoneMediaFileRenamer](https://github.com/gusper/PhoneMediaFileRenamer). Another Python project called [UGExtractPython](https://github.com/gusper/UGExtractPython) I use to scrape Ultimate Guitar to generate the list of songs I've transcribed and posted there to then share them on this site's [Music page](/music).

### Mobile apps
Windows Phone: Meds Tracker, Calendar Calculator, Gifty, and ccDismiss (PocketPC).
iOS: CalendarCalc

## Zinko Labs
This was an LLC I created back when I was creating Windows Phone apps. It's been years since I did anything with it though, so it's now [a thing of the past](https://web.archive.org/web/20190102231709/http://www.zinkolabs.com/).
