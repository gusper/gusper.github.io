## Guitar 

I created [GuitarTube.org](https://guitartube.org) in 2016. Some folks have found it useful, so I'm keeping it around. Still may do more, but we'll see. 

I've also been transcribing songs I enjoy more and more over the years and sharing them on [Ultimate Guitar](https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/contribution/6193383-gusp3r/tabs) and [some on Soundslice](https://www.soundslice.com/users/gusper/).

## 9U5P

I'm hoping to get around to recording more and will share that under the 9U5P moniker. See more over on [Spotify and other streaming services](https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/9u5p/rerise). You can also check out [my Soundcloud page](https://soundcloud.com/9u5p).

## Opus80

Back in the 90s and early aughts, I played in a band called Opus80. We haven't played a show in ages but still get together to jam whenever we get a chance. More recently we've recorded [some videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFWiSBx_elE) for charity events at work. See more on our old [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wqmfkVMIyM).
