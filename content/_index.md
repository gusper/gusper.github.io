# Hello! I'm Gus.
I'm a software engineer based out of the Pacific Northwest in North America. On the work front, I've been at [Microsoft](https://microsoft.com) since I interned back in 1998. I'm currently a Director of Engineering in the Developer Division working on [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.com). 

Outside of work, I have a rotation of hobbies I get into pretty obsessively. [Playing guitar](/music), [woodworking](/maker), and [programming](/software) are safe to say permanently on the rotation. Also dabble with [digital art](/art), [recording music](/music), and [3d-printing](/maker). I love trying to get good at something even knowing it's a never ending mission. 

This site has been around since 2000, but I simplified things in 2022. I basically started from scratch, migrated from WordPress to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), etc. If you were looking for something specific but can't find it, [email me](mailto:hello@gusperez.com) and I'll dig it up and repost it [here](/blog/).
