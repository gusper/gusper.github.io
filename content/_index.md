## Hello! I'm Gus.
I'm a software engineer based out of the Pacific Northwest in North America. On the work front, I've been at [Microsoft](https://microsoft.com) since I was an intern back in 1998. I'm currently a Director of Engineering in the Developer Division working on [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.com). 

Outside of work, I have a rotation of hobbies I get into pretty obsessively. [Playing guitar](/music), [recording music](/music), [woodworking including guitar building](/maker), and [programming](/software) are safe to say permanently on rotation. Also dabble with [digital art](/art) and [3D printing](/maker). 

This site has been around since 2000, but I basically started from scratch in 2022. If you were looking for something specific but can't find it, [email me](mailto:hello@gusperez.com) and I'll dig it up and repost it [here](/blog/).
