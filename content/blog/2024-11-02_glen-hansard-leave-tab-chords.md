This is one I guess I missed posting on Ultimate Guitar. Sharing it here in the meantime as it was one I'd posted in the past and have now been asked a couple times for it.

E5                   C#/Dbm9 
I can't wait forever is all that you said 
Badd11           Aadd9 
Before you stood up 
E5 
And you won't disappoint me 
C#/Dbm9 
I can do that myself 
Badd11                   Aadd9 
But I'm glad that you've come now if you don't mind 
C#m/E  B5 
Leave, leave, 
A5 
And free yourself at the same time 
C#m/E  B5 
Leave, leave, 
A5 
I don't understand, you've already gone 
E5 
And I hope you feel better 
C#/Dbm9 
Now that it's out 
Badd11                Aadd9 
What took yo----ou so long 
E5 
And the truth has a habit 
C#/Dbm9 
Of falling out of your mouth 
Badd11            Aadd9 
But now that it's come, if you don't mind 
C#m/E  B5 
Leave, leave, 
A5 
And please yourself at the same time 
C#m/E  B5 
Leave, leave, 
A5 
Let go of my hand, you said what you have to now 
C#m/E  B5 
Leave, leave, 
A5 
Let go of my hand, you said what you came to now 
C#m/E  B5           F#11 
Leave, le-----------eave, 
C#m/E  B5 
Leave, leave, 
F#11 
Let go of my hand, you said what you have to now 
C#m/E  B5           F#11 
Leave, le-----------eave
