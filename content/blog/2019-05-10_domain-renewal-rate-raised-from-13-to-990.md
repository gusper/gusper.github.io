I’ve collected several domain names over the years. It’s almost always the first step I take after having a new idea for a project. The truth is I rarely end up getting to a second step. Basically, I’ve become a collector of pretty uninteresting domain names. Unsurprisingly, I’m used to getting renewal notification mails every so often, and they’re always pretty much exactly what I’d expect. Yesterday though, right when I was about to archive the mail, the total cost row caught my eye. It’s going to cost me $990.66 to renew my .club domain this year. This is a teeny tiny bit more than the $13.88 I originally paid back in 2014.

I emailed Namecheap’s support and they explained how this is up to the TLD’s registrar and happens from time to time. It seems they’ve now deemed it a “premium” domain which leads to the way higher renewal price. Good times.

In this case, I use this domain solely for a single email address that forwards to multiple other accounts I have. So it’s not at all a big deal for me to bail on the domain. That said, this experience has made me paranoid about the possibility of this happening with other domains I care far more about.

Searching a bit led me to [similar stories](http://www.webhostingtalk.com/showthread.php?t=1564409) out there, but it doesn’t seem super common. I did also find [articles](https://www.thedomains.com/2019/01/11/club-domain-registration-renewal-prices-to-rise-in-2019-2020-and-2021/) about .club domains specifically raising renewal rates recently, but not at the scale I’m being asked to pay. Finally, here’s [another article](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/04/26/dot_org_price_increases/) with more details on how this is depressingly looking like it may become more the norm over time.
