<h1>PRK recoveryâ€”three year mark</h1>
<h5>December 20, 2013</h5>

<p>
    It's just a couple weeks short of three years since I went through PRK surgery. Figured I'd provide 
    an update to my original post and share how things have turned out.
</p>
<p>
    Overall, I couldn't be happier. My vision's still great. It's somewhere between 20/15 and 20/20. It 
    may have regressed a tiny bit over the last couple years but by no means a problem nowadays.
</p>
<p>
    I did deal with general dryness for a while and even to this day I'd say it's still something I'll 
    notice now and then. It's minor though and by no means something that impacts me in any significant way.
</p>
<p>
    Would I recommend it to others? Yes. Absolutely. It's been totally worth it, and I'd even consider going 
    in for a touch up in the future if it regresses enough to make it worth it and is feasible. While my 
    initial recovery lasted much longer than I had hoped, I still think it was the right call in the end.
</p>

    My wife also had it done a few months after I did. Her recovery was a breeze compared to mine and much more 
    typical of what we've seen and heard from others. Her vision going in was far worse than mine but is now 
    also at least 20/20 in both eyes if not better.
</p>
<p>
    If you're considering it, do plenty of research to get a good idea of what to expect and make sure you have 
    a doctor you really trust. It is your eyes you're messing with, so it's a pretty big deal. We both felt good 
    about it and the risk vs. reward and glad we went through with it in the end.
