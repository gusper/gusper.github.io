        <h1>My PRK Journey</h1>
        <h5>July 27, 2011</h5>
        <p>
            It's almost been eight months since I underwent
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photorefractive_keratectomy">Photorefractive Keratectomy (PRK)</a>
            eye surgery to finally get rid of my glasses/contacts. It's similar to the seemingly more common
            Lasik except for how your cornea gets exposed to the laser (at least that's how I understand it). That
            difference leads to pretty different recovery experiences: Lasik patients see instant results while PRK
            patients go through a longer, more gradual recovery process. In the end, I chose PRK over Lasik.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was very optimistic and excited about being able to see perfectly after dealing with glasses/contacts
            for 20+ years. That led me to interpret all of the descriptions of the cons and the recovery process in
            their most positive form. While I know it's impossible for a doctor to describe to a patient exactly how
            they're going to feel during recovery, I certainly had a different experience from what I envisioned it
            being.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm finally getting around to write this after weeks of slacking. I read countless posts describing a large
            variety of recovery experiences and found each and every one of them super helpful, even though, the
            majority
            were not all that encouraging. I'll warn you it's probably the longest post I've ever written. I recall
            reading
            some long ones when I went through this and appreciated every little detail, so I'm just going to let it
            flow.
        </p>
        <p>
            The actual surgery was no big deal. It took about five minutes per eye which barely even gave me time to
            build
            up any anxiety. I just did what the doctor asked and focused on staring at the light. My eyes had been
            numbed
            up so I could feel some pressure but nothing beyond that. No part of the actual procedure hurt at all. It's
            just a bit off-putting to see someone scrape your eyes with tools. I also remember smelling the laser do its
            thing and it all feeling a bit surreal that I'm so easily able to just sit there and let it happen.
        </p>
        <p>
            Immediately after the surgery, my vision was much better than I had expected. It wasn't perfect by any
            means,
            but I could totally get around on my own without any problems. I also didn't experience any pain at all; the
            closest to pain was scratchiness that just felt like my eyes were dry, but that was just discomfort at most
            and
            totally manageable. The only thing I remember having a real effect on me was a high sensitivity to light. I
            started to have to turn off lights in the house, dimmed my computer screens, and would have to turn away
            from
            bright scenes on the TV. I wore sunglasses everywhere.
        </p>
        <p>
            The next day, I went in for a post-op check-up and was still seeing reasonably well. I had some double
            vision
            in both eyes and neither were close to 20/20, but I could still do pretty much anything I wanted. The doctor
            took a look and said things were progressing well. She warned me to not get too excited about that though as
            she expected things to get worse before they improved.
        </p>
        <p>
            It turns out she was right as I woke up the following day with worse double vision (or multi-vision to be
            more
            accurate). The day after that, things were even worse, plus I started to feel some of the pain she had
            warned
            might eventually arise. The pain was a burning sensation and was at its worst as soon as I woke up in the
            morning.
            It took several minutes to gradually get my eyes to open up. By no means terrible but certainly more than
            just
            discomfort at this point.
        </p>
        <p>
            My surgery happened on a Thursday. The following Monday I got the "bandage" contact lenses removed. This
            step
            certainly qualified as pain. It was impossible for me to open my eyes; they fought me the whole way and
            opened up
            the tears dam. After a long while, I was able to open them up some which helped as they hurt the most when
            closed.
            Any eye movement when closed would lead to a scraping feeling against my eyelids. Not fun, at all.
        </p>
        <p>
            My vision at this point was pretty poor. Felt like looking through a pane of glass that had semi-clear
            grease
            spread across it. It was hazy and blurry with more and more double vision. The other downside was that I
            constantly
            <em>felt</em> my eyes now. It wasn't unbearable but very noticeable and constant. The only thing that helped
            was
            using the "Refresh Plus" eye drops. They provided a cooling sensation and kept them from drying a lot and
            helped
            ease things along. I was using those drops every ten minutes, if not more often.
        </p>
        <p>
            Woke up the next morning with my eyelids stuck shut. Used plenty of rewetting drops once again and got
            through it and
            decided to head into work. Looking back, this was just plain dumb. I got on the elevator with another person
            and
            realized I could not see well enough to recognize the person even though they were just four to five feet
            away from
            me. Looking at a computer screen was entirely futile regardless of what resolution/zoom I used. This was
            pretty
            depressing and frustrating. I was starting to realize how down this kind of thing can get you.
        </p>
        <p>
            Got a ride back home after a few minutes and surrendered to the fact that it wasn't going to be this week
            that I got
            to go back to work. These next few days were the worst as far as vision quality went. Around day 7-8, things
            started
            to show some subtle improvement. I was able to use the computer a bit, albeit only in high-contrast mode and
            at
            200-250% zoom on a 30-inch monitor. It's painful to use a computer that way and far from productive. Gave me
            a much
            deeper appreciation for anyone who always has to use those modes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally headed back to work the following Monday (day 11). Used a lot of drops and had very blurry vision,
            but was,
            at least, able to participate in meetings and talk to folks. I was still having difficulty recognizing
            people. Most
            people didn't know what I was going through as I looked totally normal -- my apologies to anyone who I
            didn't wave
            back to or acknowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
            Things fluctuated for days. Sometimes things got slightly better but then regressed. I drove for the first
            time
            twenty-seven days after the surgery. I couldn't read street signs very well but was totally able to see well
            enough
            to drive safely on my usual route to work. It had been so long that I just started to get used to not being
            able to see
            well. Eventually, I started wearing contacts again which felt amazing but not something I ever thought I'd
            need to do
            again (at least not so soon after). The contacts helped me totally get back to normal.
        </p>
        <p>
            Almost five months had passed, and while my vision had improved a fair amount, it was still far from
            perfect. I started
            to experience pretty severe headaches and some scarier symptoms. E.g., the inner half of my vision in my
            left eye would
            gray out and gradually come back to me over ten seconds or so whenever I'd squat down and back up. I could
            also
            <em>see</em> distortions in my vision that corresponded directly to my heart beating; i.e., I could
            <em>see</em> my
            heart beat. I headed into my general practitioner who ran some tests but asked me to see my eye doctor as
            well as it
            could be related to the PRK recovery.
        </p>
        <p>
            It turns out my eyes had been on steroid drops for longer than they could deal with and that led to the
            symptoms. She
            had me quickly taper off the steroid drops, and the symptoms disappeared a few days later.
        </p>
        <p>
            I had been wearing contacts for some time at this point. I got a new pair every couple of weeks or so as my
            eyes healed
            and the prescription changed. About a week after stopping the steroid drops though, I realized I was
            watching TV in
            bed <em>after </em>taking off my contacts and could see better than I would have expected. I decided to go
            without
            contacts the next day and things were pretty good. About a week after that, my vision was perfect. Good,
            good times!
        </p>
        <p>
            Long story short, my eyes turned out to be very slow healers. I dealt with poor vision for almost five
            months though
            some of that time made much easier as a result of wearing contacts. The good news is it's been over seven
            months now,
            and both eyes are 20/10. Looking back, I feel like it was all worth it and can only appreciate how long it
            took when I
            read a rough journal I kept along the way. Getting off the steroid drops ended up being the key to things
            finally getting
            better.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'll never know when the right time to have gotten off the drops would have been, but I couldn't be happier
            now. I'm
            also relieved to know I'm not going to have a "touch-up" surgery my doctor had started to think I'd need.
            Having to go
            through this all again would have been a serious downer.
        </p>
