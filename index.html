        <h1>Hello! I'm Gus Perez.</h1>
        <p>
            I had a blog from around 2000 through 2022. I've simplified things and 
            downsized to just this page. However, I recently set up a 
            <a href="https://blog.gusperez.com">new blog</a> (using 
            <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a>) as a way to easily share 
            stuff that comes up every now and then. You can check it out at 
            <a href="https://blog.gusperez.com">blog.gusperez.com</a>.
            <br/><br/>
            If you landed here looking for something from my old blog and can't find
            it, <a href="mailto:hello@gusperez.com">send 
            me an email</a> and I'll dig it up and repost it on the 
            <a href="https://blog.gusperez.com">new blog</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Contact</h2>
        <p>
            The easiest way to reach me is <a href="mailto:hello@gusperez.com">email</a>. However,
            you can also find me on <a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.social/@gusper">Mastodon</a>, 
            <a href="https://twitter.com/gusper">Twitter</a>, and
            <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gusperez/">LinkedIn</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Work</h2>
        <p>
            I work at <a href="https://microsoft.com">Microsoft</a> where I'm the Director
            of Engineering for the Visual Studio Platform team (<a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/">VS
                for Windows</a> and <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/mac/">VS for Mac</a>). More info on
            <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gusperez/">LinkedIn</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Guitar</h2>
        <h3>GuitarTube.org</h3>
        <p>
            I created <a href="https://guitartube.org">GuitarTube.org</a> in 2016. Some folks 
            have found it useful, so I'm keeping it around. Still may do more,
            but we'll see.
        </p>
        <h3>Sheet music + tabs/chords</h3>
        <p>
            Most of <a href="https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/contribution/6193383-gusp3r/tabs">
                my transcriptions</a> are on Ultimate Guitar. I've also posted
            <a href="https://www.soundslice.com/users/gusper/">some stuff</a> on 
            <a href="https://soundslice.com">Soundslice</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>Music</h2>
        <h3>9U5P</h3>
        <p>
            I'm hoping to get around to recording more and will share that under the 9U5P moniker.
            See more over on <a href="https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/9u5p/rerise">Spotify and
                other streaming services.</a> You can also check out my
            <a href="https://soundcloud.com/9u5p">Soundcloud page</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>Opus80</h3>
        <p>
            Back in the day, I played in a band called Opus80. Haven't played a show in ages but
            still get together to jam whenever we get a chance. More recently we've
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFWiSBx_elE">recorded some videos</a> for some
            charity events at work. See more on our old
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wqmfkVMIyM">YouTube channel</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Woodworking</h2>
        <p>
            I'm learning how to make stuff with wood. See more

        <h3>Windows</h3>
        <p>
            Lots of stuff over the years, much of which isn't all that useful nowadays. Here's a
            quick list of app names and I've provided links to GitHub repos for any that I shared there:
            <a href="https://github.com/gusper/Wordy">Wordy</a>,

        </p>

        <h3>Web</h3>
        <p>
            Only one still up is <a href="https://guitartube.org">GuitarTube.org</a>. Some others that
            are no longer around are Roomdash (<a href="https://github.com/gusper/Roomdash">GitHub repo</a>)
            and Countdowns.me.
        </p>

        <h3>Browser extensions</h3>
        <p>
            <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/linksmith/ceogkejjjehhiacafhoplekoldlcfbhp">LinkSmith</a>
        </p>

        <h3>Visual Studio and VS Code extensions</h3>
        <p>
            <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gusper.songtxt">SongTxt</a>

        <h2>Photography</h2>
        <p>
            Haven't been doing as much as I used to, but you can check out some of photos on
            <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gusperez/sets/">flickr</a> and
            <a href="https://500px.com/gusper">500px</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Zinko Labs</h2>
        <p>
            This was an LLC I created back when I was creating Windows Phone apps. It's been years since I did anything
            with it though, so it's now a thing of the past.
