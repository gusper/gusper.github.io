<h1>Hello!</h1>
<p>
    I'm Gus Perez. I had a WordPress blog from around 2000 through 2022. I've simplified
    things and just have this page now. However, I've kept some of the content that got 
    most views over the last few years below. If you can't find something you used to find
    here, <a href="mailto:hello@gusperez.com">send me an email</a> and I'll try to dig it 
    up for you. 
</p>

<h2>Need to reach me?</h2>
<p>
    The easiest way to reach me is <a href="mailto:hello@gusperez.com">email</a>. However, 
    you can also find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/gusper">Twitter</a> and 
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gusperez/">LinkedIn</a>.
</p>

<h2>Guitar + Music</h2>
<h3>GuitarTube.org</h3>
<p>
    I created <a href="https://guitartube.org">GuitarTube.org</a> in 2016. It seems there
    are some folks who have found it useful, so I'm keeping it around. Still may do more 
    too, but we'll see. 
</p>
<h3>Ultimate Guitar</h3>
<p>
    If you're looking for any song transcriptions, head over to Ultimate Guitar where 
    I've also contributed most of the tabs I had shared on the blog. 
    <a href="https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/contribution/6193383-gusp3r/tabs">Click here</a>
    to see a list of all of the tabs/chord sheets I've posted on that site. 
</p>
<h3>Soundslice</h3>
<p>
    I've also posted some stuff on Soundslice  
    <a href="https://www.soundslice.com/users/gusper/">here</a>.
</p>
<h3>9u5p</h3>
<p>
    I'm hoping to get around to recording more and will share that under the 9u5p moniker. 
    See more over at <a href="https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/9u5p/rerise">Spotify, 
    Apple Music, Amazon Music, etc.</a> You can also check out my 
    <a href="https://soundcloud.com/9u5p">Soundslice page</a>.
</p>
<h3>Opus80</h3>
<p>
    Back in the day, I played in a band called Opus80. Haven't played a show in ages but
    still get together to jam whenever we get a chance. More recently we've 
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFWiSBx_elE">recorded some videos</a> for some  
    charity events at work. See more on our old 
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wqmfkVMIyM">YouTube channel</a>.
</p>

<h2>Software</h2>

    Lots of stuff over the years, much of which isn't all that useful nowadays. Here's a 
    quick list of app names and I've provided links to GitHub repos for any that I shared there:

</p>

<h2>Writing</h2>
<p>
    Here are some of the posts that seemed worth keeping around:
    <p>July 27, 2011: <a href="posts/2011-07-27_my-prk-journey.html" target="_blank">My PRK journey</a></p>
    <p>December 20, 2013: <a href="posts/2013-12-20_prk-recovery-three-year-mark.html" target="_blank">PRK recoveryâ€”three year mark</a></p>

<h2>Photography</h2>
<p>
    Haven't been doing as much as I used to, but you can check out some of photos on 
    <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gusperez/sets/">flickr</a> and 
    <a href="http://500px.com/gusper">500px</a>.
</p>

<h2>Zinko Labs</h2>
<p>
    This was an LLC I created back when I was creating Windows Phone apps. It's been years since I did anything
    with it though, so it's now a thing of the past.
